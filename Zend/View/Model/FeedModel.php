 * @todo       This should probably take the $variables passed as a data structure
 *             and create a Zend\Feed\Writer\Feed object from it. As such, we should
 *             likely also create some sort of Factory object for feeds that would
 *             take a structured assoc array and use it to populate a Feed object.
